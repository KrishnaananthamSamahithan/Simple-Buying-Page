            <h2>Traditional craft products in Sri Lanka</h2>
            <p>When it comes to Sri Lankan arts and crafts, color, creativity, and commerce are in abundance. Tradition and heritage are paramount, and since the beginning of time, people have been producing everything from jewelry to masks, lacquerware, and pottery here. Even though it stings to call something so proud of its cultural past a "souvenir," there are instances</p>

            <h2>Masks</h2>
            <p> Deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan folklore, masks also serve a practical purpose when they are employed in rituals and healing ceremonies. Often referred to as "devil dances," some of these dance-drama productions carry a complex tale while being performed by skilled dancers and actors donning these masks.</p>

            <h2>Handloom</h2>
            <p>A long time ago, the handloom was only used by the country's royalty and most prominent citizens, and particular towns were chosen to perform the skill. However, Handloom is currently mostly found as a self-employed or entrepreneurial activity all throughout the island where this skill that has been passed down from generation to generation has been resurrected and practiced.
                Sri Lankan handloom products include clothing, books, bags, saris, and other everyday items like pillow covers, curtains, and other home decor.</p>

            <h2>Lacquer work (Laksha)</h2>
            <p>These expertly crafted traditional handicrafts are a top pick for visitors and others looking for mementos of Sri Lankan culture. Over the years, the craft of lacquer making has expanded throughout the island from its origins in central Sri Lanka. 
                A wax that is imported from India serves as the foundation for traditional lacquerware. This wax is made from a particular species of insect. While some people still utilize traditional methods, others prefer to use new equipment and techniques that have become available over time for creating these intricate and beautiful designs.
                On the entire island, lacquer work can be seen on walking sticks, flag and hand fan handles, bowls, vases, containers, and decorative items.</p>
